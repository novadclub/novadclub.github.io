### Cloud Providers

Your clients are your livelihood. Your reputation depends on their
ability to protect their customers' data.  When you implement
VSCRAM&trade;, VLockdown&trade;, and VDelete&trade;, you are stopping
terrorists and criminals from destroying your business.

#### Implement Our Recommendations

Even the smallest step will be helpful.  For example, you could
implement Vdelete for backups.  This would help in the worst case
scenarios.  Even one day's delay would allow a customer to contact you
to recover from an extortionist

You already manage migrations for hardware failures. VSCRAM can be
implemented like a managed migration of a customer's virtual machines.

Your network operations center already asks customers to answer
security questions to identify themselves.  VSCRAM and VLockdown codes
are just a special form of security question, which trigger an
operation.  Putting any time of "escalated event" secret code into
your system would be a step in the right direction.

#### Be A Leader

[Please join our group on LinkedIn]({{ site.linked_in_url }}),
and connect with other cloud providers and clients.  By working together,
we can come up with standards and open source implementations for
these sensible cyber safeguards.
