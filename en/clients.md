### Cloud Clients

Your customers depend on you to keep their data safe.  You cannot do
this alone or without the proper tools.  Your cloud provider is your
partner.  Please ask them to join NoVAD and to implement our sensible
cyber safeguards.

#### Do This First

Even without VSCRAM, VLockdown, and VDelete, you
can help safeguard your customers' data with the following standard
security measures.

{: .nv_termlist}
Secure Email Address
: Get a random email address from a 3rd party email provider for your
cloud account login.  Keep this address secret, never fowarding emails
from this account and giving out on a need to know basis only

Multi-Factor Authentication
: Use multi-factor authentication to login to your cloud provider.  If
your cloud provider doesn't allow this, ask them.

Random Secret Questions
: Generate long random sentences (gibberish) as answers to the secret
questions on your cloud account.

Offline And Offsite Backups
: Perform regular offsite backups and keep offline copies.  Verify you
can restore your site completely from the offline copies.

: Secure Your Cloud
Employ standard system security practices.  Every machine should be
secured as if it were vulnerable to a front-line attack.
