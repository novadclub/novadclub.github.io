#### The Problem

On June 17th, 2014, [Code Spaces](http://www.codespaces.com) was completely destroyed by an extortionist.

{:nvdef: .well .nv_codespaces_quote}
&ldquo;Code Spaces will not be able to operate beyond this point, the cost of resolving this issue to date and the expected cost of refunding customers who have been left without the service they paid for will put Code Spaces in a irreversible position both financially and in terms of on going credibility.&rdquo;
{: nvdef}

Code Spaces had time to stop the attack. Without the right tools, they were helpless.

&ldquo;We took action to take control back of our panel by changing
passwords, however the intruder had prepared for this and had already
created a number of backup logins to the panel and upon seeing us make
the attempted recovery of the account he proceeded to randomly delete
artifacts from the panel.&rdquo;

#### The Solution
{: #nv-solution}

We need the equivalent of airbags to prevent virtually assured
destruction by criminals, terrorists, and ordinary mistakes in the
cloud.

{: .nv_termlist}
VSCRAM&trade;
: Nuclear reactors have a SCRAM system, which
forces a large insertion of negative reactivity.  Clients should have
the ability to call in or text a VSCRAM code to a cloud service
provider to force an immediate shutdown and freeze all of the client's
servers and assets.  You can turn your computer and car off when problems
happen.  The cloud needs a power-off button, too.

VLockdown&trade;
: If Code Spaces could have locked down administrative access, the
attack would have been stopped without disrupting normal operations.
Clients should have a VLockdown code to freeze all adminstrative
access and destructive operations.

VDelete&trade;
: Like the Trash can on your desktop, deleted cloud assets should not be
destroyed immediately.  Even a few hours delay before "emptying the
trash" would have helped Code Spaces save their business.
